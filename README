Guau! Baby Log v0.1

Wish you could remember all those moments when your new-born baby
started to do things you teach him/her? When did it said 'Dad' for the
first time? When was he/she capable of standing up by him/herself?

Guau! Baby Log is a webapp that allows you to take note on the
important moments you wish or need to remember about the first months
of life of your baby. It has support for a photo gallery. It also
hides all the information behind a password-protected account, away
from the public eye.

Enjoy, and remember...
